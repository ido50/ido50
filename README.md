# Ido Perlmuter

Hi there. I am Ido Perlmuter, also known by the ridiculous net handle "ido50". I am a Software Engineer (and former Mechanical Engineer) with over two decades of experience.

I run my own business called [Shift-Delete](https://shift-delete.io/), which provides software development, training and consultancy services to both early-stage startups and established corporations.

My personal blog is at [ido50.net](https://ido50.net/).
